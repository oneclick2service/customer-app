### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.dart` and `MyComponent_test.dart` in the same directory).
- Use `flutter test` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Flutter test configuration.
- The app follows MVVM architecture with Provider state management.
- Supabase is used for backend services including authentication, database, and real-time features.
